# Custom PHP build scripts for PocketMine-MP

## compile.sh

Use this script to build the custom PHP binary. Make sure you have ``make autoconf automake libtool m4 wget getconf gzip bzip2 bison g++``.

### Additional notes
#### Mac OSX (native compile)
- Most dependencies can be installed using Homebrew
- You will additionally need `glibtool` (GNU libtool, xcode libtool won't work)
- You also MUST specify target as `mac` or `mac64` if building for Mac, on Mac.

#### Android 64-bit (cross-compile)
- Only aarch64 targets are supported for Android cross-compile.
- The `aarch64-linux-musl` toolchain is required. You can compile and install it using https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make
- Android cross-compile binaries MUST be compiled statically (using `-s`) or the binary will not work correctly.
- It is strongly recommended that you enable abusive optimizations for Android targets (`-f` flag) for best performance.
